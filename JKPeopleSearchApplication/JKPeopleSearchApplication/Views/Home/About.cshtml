<h3>@ViewBag.Message</h3>

<p style="max-width: 620px">This application is created as a sample of a search engine that uses ajax to
    do a partial page refresh for the search, providing instant results.
    The requests are passed back and forth using json, per project requirements,
    but a PartialViewResult would likely be more maintainable and cleaner.
